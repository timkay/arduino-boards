# arduino-boards
Select which arduino boards show up in the Boards Manager

On Windows, download only build/arduino-boards.exe. It works, but it
is very slow to start because it creates a temporary folder with a
bunch of assets in it.

Install Python 3, PySimpleGUI, and whatever. Start with go.bat.
